# 🚀 Project Overview

OrionOps is a modern **AI-powered Security Operations Center (SOC)** designed to automate cyber incident investigations using a collaborative **multi-agent architecture**.

In OrionOps multiple specialized AI agents coordinated through an agent orchestration workflow to investigate cybersecurity incidents from initial alert intake to executive report generation.

Instead of relying on a single AI model, OrionOps coordinates specialized agents responsible for investigation, threat intelligence, timeline reconstruction, risk analysis, response planning, and executive reporting.

The platform demonstrates how AI agents can work together to reduce analyst workload while improving investigation speed and consistency.

This project was developed as part of the **Google AI Agents: Intensive Vibe Coding Capstone Project (Kaggle 2026).**

# 🏆 Google AI Agents Capstone

This project demonstrates concepts explored during Google's AI Agents program, including:

Multi-Agent Orchestration
Specialised AI Agents
Agent Orchestration
Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) Architecture
Agent orchestration using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
Secure AI Design
Enterprise Security Automation
Human-in-the-loop Investigation

The repository includes:

Production-style ADK backend showcasing a modular multi-agent architecture.

Demo backend used for the interactive frontend demonstration and presentation.

# 🔄 Agent Orchestration

OrionOps follows an orchestrated multi-agent architecture where a central Investigation Manager coordinates specialized AI agents. Each agent performs a dedicated task incident intake, threat intelligence, timeline reconstruction, risk assessment, response planning, and report generation before passing structured context to the next stage, creating an explainable and modular investigation workflow.

# ⚙ Google ADK Integration

This repository contains the original **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** implementation developed during the capstone project.

The project includes:

- Modular ADK agent architecture
- Individual AI agents
- Agent manager
- Memory services
- Security tools
- Report generation pipeline
- SQLite persistence

Due to API quota limitations encountered during development, a lightweight **Demo Backend** was also created to simulate realistic multi-agent execution while preserving the complete frontend experience.

This repository therefore contains both:

- **Original ADK Backend**
- **Demo Backend used for demonstration**
